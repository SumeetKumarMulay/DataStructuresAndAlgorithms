# Data Structure and Algorithms

This is my collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms. My goal is simple: to maintain this as an archive and update it as needed. Any and all pull requests are welcome! 

## How to run the functions?

For the most part, you can use the function_runner.py script. It’s nothing special, but it allows timing of function execution. If you can’t use the function runner, I recommend running each file as an individual script. Also, I suggest keeping the .vscode directory, as it contains essential settings for the folder structure to work correctly.

## Some commands to get you started on the terminal:

**NOTE**: Before you go any further make sure you have python3 installed and running without it you will not be able to run the scripts.

[here is a link to get you started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

1. python3 function_runner.py
2. python3 <name of the script>
